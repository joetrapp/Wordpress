How to create a development website alongside your production website in cPanel

-Add subdomain to website. I like to use staging.URL.com

-Create directory where you would like to have the new website hosted

-Create new FTP user

-OPT: Create redirect for staging.whatever -> public_html/DIR

-In Installatron, clone your Wordpress program

-Change settings as per usage: Create new database if you are creating a fresh install, Copy database if you would like to work on a mirrored site

-Disable site indexing in WP for Search Engines

-Disable non-logged in user access?

-Profit. Access website using staging.URL.com/wp-admin.
